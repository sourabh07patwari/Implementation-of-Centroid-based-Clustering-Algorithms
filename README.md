# Implementation-of-Centroid-based-Clustering-Algorithms
Implemented clustering algorithms from scratch of k-means and k-means++ on three different datasets.
Verified the accuracy of clustering algorithms using Hamming distance validation technique. 
K-means++ showed the best results in most datasets.
Also calculated the optimum number of clusters for given datasets using Elbow Method (WCSS-With-in Cluster Sums of Squares).
